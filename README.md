2. Clone this repository.

3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`, for Node version I use `Node.js 16 LTS`.

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the required environment variables:
```
REMOTE_HOST=            // This should be your Azure Function App remote host url
API_GET_IMAGES=         // getImages API endpoint, e.g. /api/getImages
API_GET_SUGGESTIONS=    // getChatGPTSuggestion API endpoint
API_GENERATE_IMAGE=     // generateImage API endpoint
WEBSITE=                // URL to website
```
5. Download **Expo Go** app from Google Play/App Store, run `npx expo start` in the terminal to start the development server,  then scan the QR Code within Expo Go app (Android) or your phone's camera app (iOS).

6. Or to build the app, run the app on your preferred platform (iOS or Android) using `npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release` or `npx expo run:android --variant release`, Android Studio or Xcode is needed depends on which platform you choose.

7. Enjoy generating and exploring images based on your text prompts! üåà
